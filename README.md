Game of chaos 

The idea of game is that you have 3 points in a plane (not laying on one line).
Starting point: 
Choose randomly one point inside this triangle.
Iterative point:
Next you randomly choose one of the vertex of the triangle and add a point in the half of the way to this point. This is your next starting point.
Repeat until you get around 1000 iterations then you will receive something similar to Sierpinski's Triangle.

I will try to simulate different objects. Maybe in a square or octagon there will be similar fractals. Let's see.

But after some adjustment reality seems more bearable:  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26064347/111076766-f8ba3300-84ed-11eb-8116-52bba2770b3d.png)
